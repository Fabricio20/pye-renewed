Information Collection and Use:

I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information. The information that I request will be collected by the bot and saved on an encrypted database.

Personally Identifiable Information collected:
- Discord Messages (for commands, for example, welcome message).
- Nationality (provided by the user for the `profile` command).
- Discord Username#Tag (used for Cookie Leaderboard).

Log Data:
In a case of an error in the bot, I collect data and information related to the command execution, which is stored at most for 30 days. This is used to reproduce the issue and fix the bug.

Data Retention:
- Most user-generated data is stored for as long as the bot can see the server (guild), after that, a timer of 30 days starts ticking, once it reaches 30 days, all guild-related data
is permanently deleted from the bot. This allows you to kick/reinvite the bot without losing your settings, as well as reducing resource usage on our end.
